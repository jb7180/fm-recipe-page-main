## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use rem sizing for responsiveness and I also learned how to use a wrapper div.

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```html
<div class="wrapper"></div>
```css
body {
  line-height: 1.75rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing techniques for styling tables. That was a challege for me on this project.
